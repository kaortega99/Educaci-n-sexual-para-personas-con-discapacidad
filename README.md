# Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Knowledge among Women with Disabilities in Ecuador

## Description
This research project explores the state of knowledge regarding sexual and reproductive health (SRH) among women with disabilities in Ecuador. The data is sourced from the 2019 ENSANUT survey. The goal of the project is to analyze the SRH education gaps between women with disabilities and those without, identify regional disparities, and evaluate the effectiveness of SRH programs across different provinces, with a focus on rural vs. urban areas.

## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of SRH knowledge across different provinces and between rural and urban populations.
- Compare SRH knowledge between women with and without disabilities.
- Use sampling weights to ensure the representativeness of the survey data.
- Provide insights on how to improve SRH education for women with disabilities in Ecuador.
